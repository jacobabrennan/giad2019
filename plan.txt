--------------------------------------------------
Game Idea: Rogue-like Missions

Summary: Single Player Rogue-like with selectable scenarios, and a scenario editor (added later)

What is it actually?:
The user accesses the game as an html page via their web-browser
A canvas displays the game, and input is collected via the keyboard
A typical session follows thusly:
    The player views the title screen, and presses the space bar
    The player selects or creates a character
    The player selects a campaign
    The player selects a scenario
    The player plays the scenario to completion
    The player is presented a summary screen, for either game over or completion
    The player is redirected to the 
        character creation, in case of game over
        scenario selection, in case of win with further scenarios available in campaign
        or the title screen, in case of win with no further scenarios available in campaign

What does gameplay look like?:
The game plays similarly to goblin like
A text based tiled map is the main focus
Tiles are revealed as the come into visibility
Outside of view are hidden, and tiles outside view are displayed in a "dimmed" color scheme
A side panel displays the status, menus, and messages
Animations show change in health

What kind of game objects exist?:
Tiles: the basic environment of the game world, the "map" consists of these
    Floor: nonsolid, transparent
    Wall: solid, opaque
    Door: complex... should this be a block?
    Entrance: The player starts here
    Exit: if present, the player must reach here to end the scenario
Actors: The player, enemies, and perhaps other features such as NPCs or animals
Blocks:
    Solid objects that take up space, such as furniture
    can be interactive, such as searching a chest
Items:
    can be obtained and used by actors
    Non-solid objects that are located in space but don't take up space
Triggers:
    can be attached to any of the other object types
    Is one of several types:
        Goal - all goals must be acheived in order to complete the game
            Tile: Tile is entered by the player
            Actor: player has killed the actor
            Block: Block must be interacted with
            Item: Item must be collected
        Info - Displays information to the player
            Tile: when the player enters
            Actor: the actor is killed
            Block: The block is interacted with
            Item: The item is used

Is it GOOD?:
Finishable: Maybe
Fun: Yes
Multiplayer: No
Goblin-world-based: No

How is the map constructed?

Single Scenario at a time. Single Map at a time.
Map = Grid tile ids, Grid of linked contents lists
Map.getTile(x, y)
Map.getContents(x, y)
Map.placeTile(tile, x, y)
Map.placeContainable(containable, x, y)
